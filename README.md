# Custom Snake

Custom Snake is a game I created as a final project for my AP Computer Science Principles class in 2019. Over a couple months, I worked to design, program, and debug my game in Unity and C#.

## Gameplay

The game is my interpretation of the classic Snake as a roguelite. Starting from nothing, the player must improve their Snake skills in order to upgrade not only their character's abilities, but also the visual aesthetics of the game as well.
